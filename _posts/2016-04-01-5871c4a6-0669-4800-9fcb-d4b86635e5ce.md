It's all about Design. Well, GOOD design. 

Since I was a youngster, I inherently understood good design. Better yet, I understood what may not have been good design. It was a matter of FEEL. Organically, if you're paying attention, you can feel whether or not something has a good design aesthetic to it or not. Take this photo of a home in Cardiff, Ca. The design is by Lindsay Brown of The Brown Studio. It is clean. It has balance. I borrows from the land itself, with elements of nature: wood, stone, concrete. Even the lawn is balanced, both visually as well as systematically, in that it WORKS alongside nature, not fight it.
