It's all about Good Design.

I was having a conversation recently with my S.O. (significant other), or as she put it, her "H.E." (husband equivalent)...about What Is Good Design. And this sparked a hearty conversation. 

In my opinion, Good Design should be in everything. Yes; from buildings (homes, offices, landmarks), to our toothbrushes, our shoes, our cars...and even our Customer Service.

What? Good Design in Customer Service? Why not.

GOOD DESIGN is that tasteful collection of proper balance, strong form, environmental integration and clean lines.
